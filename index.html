<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it? -->

<!-- Ans-<!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag of HTML; it is a document type declaration (DTD) or document type definition. It is used to specify the version of HTML or XHTML that a web page is written in.

The purpose of the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is to inform the web browser about the type of markup language used in the document. It helps the browser to interpret and display the content correctly by triggering the appropriate rendering mode.

In HTML5, <!DOCTYPE html> is the doctype declaration used to indicate that the page is written in HTML5. It is a required declaration and should be placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag.

By including the correct doctype declaration, web developers ensure that their web pages are rendered consistently across different browsers and comply with the HTML specification. It helps to avoid compatibility issues and ensures that the web page is interpreted and displayed correctly. -->

<!-- Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it? -->

<!-- Ans- Semantic tags in HTML are specific HTML elements that carry meaning or describe the content they contain. These tags provide a way to structure and define the different parts of a web page based on their meaning or purpose, rather than just their appearance. Semantic tags help both humans and search engines understand the structure and content of a web page.

Here are some commonly used semantic tags in HTML5:

<header>: Represents the introductory content or a container for a group of introductory or navigational elements.

<nav>: Defines a section containing navigation links.

<main>: Represents the main content of the document.

<article>: Represents a self-contained composition that could be independently distributed or syndicated.

<section>: Defines a section in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other generic section of content.

<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, such as sidebars or pull quotes.

<footer>: Defines the footer or the closing section of a document or a section.

Semantic tags provide several benefits:

Improved accessibility: By using semantic tags, it becomes easier for assistive technologies like screen readers to interpret and navigate through the content. This helps individuals with disabilities access the web more effectively.

Search engine optimization (SEO): Search engines can better understand the structure and meaning of the content when semantic tags are used. This can potentially improve the visibility and ranking of a web page in search engine results.

Maintainable code: Semantic tags contribute to the readability and maintainability of the codebase. They provide a clear structure, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the code in the future.

Future-proofing: Semantic tags help ensure that your web page remains compatible with future versions of HTML. As new semantic tags are introduced, they can be adopted to enhance the structure and semantics of your content.

In summary, semantic tags in HTML improve accessibility, SEO, code maintainability, and future compatibility. They provide a more meaningful and structured representation of the content, benefiting both humans and machines interacting with the web page. -->

<!-- Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements? -->

<!-- Ans-  HTML tags define the structure and presentation of elements, while HTML elements consist of tags, along with the content they enclose. Elements are the building blocks of an HTML document, and tags are used to create and define those elements. -->

<!-- What are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions? -->

<!-- Ans- HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several advancements and improvements over its previous versions. Here are some of the advantages of HTML5:

Semantics: HTML5 introduced a set of new semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>) that provide clearer meaning to the structure of web documents. This allows search engines, screen readers, and other technologies to better understand and interpret the content.

Multimedia Support: HTML5 provides built-in support for audio and video elements (<audio> and <video>), eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This enables easier integration and playback of media content directly within the web browser.

Canvas and Graphics: HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, which allows dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and interactive content using JavaScript. It provides a powerful and flexible platform for creating visual experiences without relying on external technologies.

Mobile-Friendly: HTML5 incorporates features and improvements that cater to mobile devices and responsive web design. It includes capabilities such as device orientation detection, geolocation support, and touch events, making it easier to build mobile-friendly and cross-platform web applications.

Offline and Storage: HTML5 introduced the ability to store data locally in the user's browser using the Web Storage API (localStorage and sessionStorage). It also introduced the Application Cache API, which enables web applications to work offline by caching the required resources.

Improved Forms: HTML5 introduced new form input types (e.g., email, date, number) and attributes (e.g., required, pattern) that simplify form validation and enhance the user experience. It also introduced the <datalist> element, which provides auto-completion suggestions for input fields.

Web Workers and WebSockets: HTML5 introduced Web Workers, which allow background scripts to run separately from the main browser thread, improving performance and responsiveness. Additionally, HTML5 introduced WebSockets, enabling real-time communication between the web browser and a server, facilitating efficient bidirectional communication.

Simplified Markup: HTML5 reduces the reliance on complex and unnecessary markup, such as <div> and <span> elements used solely for styling purposes. It encourages the use of more meaningful and semantic elements, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. -->

<!-- What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag? -->

<!-- Ans- The <img> tag is specifically used to insert an image into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and requires the src attribute, which specifies the source (URL or file path) of the image. The <img> tag is primarily responsible for displaying the image on the web page.

        The <figure> tag is used to encapsulate and represent self-contained content, typically accompanied by a caption or description. It can contain various types of content, including images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, code snippets, etc. The <figure> element provides semantic meaning to a group of related content within an HTML document. -->

<!-- What’s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some global attributes? -->


<!-- Ans- Tag: A tag is an HTML element that defines the structure and content of an HTML document. Tags are used to enclose specific content and provide meaning and structure to the document. They are represented by angle brackets (< and >) and appear as opening and closing tags.

Attribute: An attribute provides additional information or properties to an HTML element. Attributes are used within the opening tag of an element and provide extra details or instructions about how the element should behave or appear. They are composed of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=). Ex-  src and alt attributes -->
